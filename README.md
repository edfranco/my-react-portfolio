This website itself was built using React. I used CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid to style the layout. I also have a very simple server deployed on heroku that is used to send messages from this site's contact form to my personal email. 

On this site you can learn a little about me, Eduardo Franco. You can read a bit about my work history and download my official resume in docx format. You can also view some of my favorite projects and deploy them. Additionally you can contact me directly from the site itself.

- If you refresh the page the site will render the domain host's default 404 page. This may be a problem with the domain host's ability to work with React.
